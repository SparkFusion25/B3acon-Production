## 🚨 **CRITICAL MISSING ITEMS**

### 1. **GitHub Repository** (BLOCKING)
Without this, you cannot deploy to Netlify. This is the #1 priority.

### 2. **Database Migration** (BLOCKING)
Your Supabase project needs the database schema. Without this, the app won't work.

### 3. **Environment Variables** (BLOCKING)
The app needs to know how to connect to your Supabase database.
