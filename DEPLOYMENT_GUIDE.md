## üåê Step 3: Environment Configuration (15 minutes)

### 3.1 Create Production Environment File
1. Copy `setup-production.env` to `.env`
2. Fill in all the required values:

```bash
# CRITICAL - Get these from your Supabase project settings
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# CRITICAL - Get these from Stripe dashboard
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
VITE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
VITE_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# REQUIRED - Your domain
VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3.2 Verify Configuration
Run locally to test:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Stripe checkout works (test mode first)

---

## üîß Step 4: Fix Remaining Issues (60 minutes)

### 4.1 Complete Icon Imports
Some components still need icon imports fixed. Run:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
If you see icon-related errors, add the missing imports to each component.

### 4.2 Update Mock Data Structure
The mock data needs to align with the new TypeScript interfaces:
1. Open `src/data/mockAgencyData.ts`
2. Update the structure to match the interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`
3. Add missing properties like `created_at`, `updated_at`, etc.

### 4.3 Add Null Safety for Supabase
Add null checks in components that use Supabase:
```typescript
if (!supabase) {
  console.error('Supabase not configured');
  return;
}
```

---

## üöÄ Step 5: Deploy to Production (30 minutes)

### 5.1 Build and Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Preview site loads correctly
- [ ] All pages navigate properly

### 5.2 Deploy to Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
3. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. Deploy!

### 5.3 Configure Custom Domain
1. Add your domain in Netlify "Domain management"
2. Update DNS records:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
   
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   ```
3. Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)
